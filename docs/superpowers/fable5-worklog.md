# Fable 5 worklog — 2026-07-10 improvement plan

Running log of the `fable5/*` PR series executing
[the improvement plan](plans/2026-07-10-fable5-coding-improvements.md).
One entry per merged PR, newest last. Worklog entries are committed directly
to `main` as post-merge bookkeeping (docs-only) so parallel workstream
branches never conflict on this file.

Conventions in effect for the series: CI (`lint.yml`) green before every
merge; squash-merge to match repo history; migrations hand-written;
authoring and review are separate passes (workstreams are implemented by
subagents in isolated worktrees or by the orchestrator, and reviewed by the
other party before ship). Commit trailers use `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus
4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>` exactly as specified in the master prompt —
noting that the executor is Claude Fable 5, so the trailer's model name is
inherited from the prompt, not a claim about which model wrote the code.

## PR #131 — W-B: secret-leak prevention (merged 2026-07-10)

- gitleaks full-history CI gate (`secrets` job in lint.yml); config extends
  default rules with **no** path allowlists — the two known false positives
  (public Segment writeKey + reCAPTCHA siteKey inside checked-in scraped-page
  fixtures) are fingerprint-suppressed in `.gitleaksignore`. Opt-in local
  pre-commit hook documented in README "Secret hygiene".
- `npm run check:bundle`: scans every client-visible build artifact
  (`.next/static/**` + prerendered `.html`/`.rsc`/`.body`) for server env
  identifier names and for canary secret *values* that CI now plants at build
  time (`SUPABASE_URL` deliberately stays unset so the secret-free smoke
  contract holds).
- `lib/db.ts` / `lib/queries.ts` now `import "server-only"` — a client-graph
  import is a build failure, not a comment. Boundary documented in
  `web/AGENTS.md`.
- `.gitignore` now covers all `.env` variants (`.env.production` etc. were
  previously uncovered).
- Verified by exercising all three failure modes (client import of db.ts →
  build fails; identifier in client component → bundle scan fails; planted
  PAT-shaped string → gitleaks flags).
- Integration note for W-A: vitest configs that import `lib/queries.ts` must
  alias `server-only` to a stub (the W-A branch was told mid-flight).

## PR #132 — W-E.3 + W-C.1: shared per-domain throttle (merged 2026-07-10)

- New `pipeline/src/nous/sources/_http.py`: `DomainThrottle` (per-domain
  asyncio locks + monotonic timestamps, process-wide `DEFAULT_THROTTLE`
  registry, injectable for tests) and `ThrottledHTTPClient` (throttled GET +
  the shared tenacity policy: retry 429/5xx/timeouts, never ConnectError).
- Fixes the verified W-C.1 bug: `HomepageClient`, `HeadlessBrowserClient`,
  and `NewsClient` each kept per-instance lock dicts, so two transports
  double-hit a host despite docstrings claiming cooperation. All three now
  share the default registry; the curl_cffi Chrome-impersonation fallback
  and the Playwright path pay the same per-domain toll.
- Behavior deliberately unified: the timestamp now stamps in a `finally`
  (failed requests count against the interval — strictly more polite).
- 9 new tests incl. the headline regression: a `HomepageClient` and a
  `HeadlessBrowserClient` hitting one host never fire closer than the min
  interval. Suite: 805 passed. Authored by a worktree subagent; reviewed by
  the orchestrator before ship.

## PR #133 — W-C.5 + W-C.6: current-state docs + backfill runbook (merged 2026-07-10)

- CLAUDE.md: migrations are hand-written (the `--autogenerate` guidance was
  stale and dangerous — autogenerate drops trigram/partial/unique indexes);
  documents the real cron cadence (3-hourly pipeline + weekly discovery) and
  scopes the free-tier rule around the standing DeepSeek exception.
- `nous-technical-spec.md`: the Form-D banner became a full current-state
  banner (discovery spine = VC portfolios + news, DeepSeek runtime, cadence,
  migration convention, pointers to README/CLAUDE.md).
- W-C.6: `pipeline.yml` gains a `run_rejudge_nonstartup` dispatch input
  wiring the existing `judge-eligibility --rejudge-nonstartup-signals` flag
  (workflow now at GitHub's 25-input cap — the next input added must
  displace one); the bounded sweep procedure for the non-US + non-startup
  drains is documented in `docs/runbooks/non-us-and-nonstartup-backfill.md`.

## PR #134 — W-C.3 (pipeline): one aggregator blocklist (merged 2026-07-10)

- `reject_hosts.AGGREGATOR_HOSTS` is now the single blocklist; the DDG copy
  (`AGGREGATOR_DOMAINS`) and `extract_funding._IMAGE_HOSTS` are gone. New
  `is_aggregator_host()` carries the one matching implementation; DDG's
  `is_aggregator()` and `is_aggregator_url()` both delegate. Strictly wider
  rejection (image/CDN hosts + duckduckgo.com everywhere); drift-guard tests
  pin every former single-list entry.

## PR #135 — W-A: web test suite (merged 2026-07-10)

- Vitest 4 + RTL 16 (jsdom) scaffolding; 130 tests across format/spotlight/
  compare-store/local-stores/queries/components/husk; chainable Supabase mock
  at the `createSupabaseServerClient` seam; `server-only` stubbed via alias.
- Playwright smoke grew structural cases (full filter querystring, /compare
  empty states, /api/export 200-CSV-or-deliberate-503 contract) + a
  data-backed browse→filter→company→compare→CSV journey behind
  SMOKE_HAS_DATA=1. CI web job now runs `npm run test` between Lint and Build.
- Zero production-source changes. Breakage drill: disabling the META_LEAK
  filter fails exactly the 3 leak-guard tests.

## PR #136 — W-E.1: LLM eval golden set + harness (merged 2026-07-10)

- `nous.evals` package + `nous eval-prompts` CLI: offline CI gate replays
  committed recordings through the runtime parse/validate/normalize path and
  scores vs hand-checked expected.json against `baseline.json` floors, with a
  per-metric delta table; live record mode (DEEPSEEK_API_KEY) refreshes
  recordings. 40 hand-written fixtures (20 per prompt) for
  company_description + funding_extraction; recordings are
  provenance:"simulated" until re-recorded live (no local key exists —
  re-record before/with W-F). Degraded-prompt drill: 4 mangled recordings
  fail the gate with a readable six-metric delta report.

## PR #137 — W-E.2: prompt_version provenance (merged 2026-07-10)

- `PROMPT_VERSION` constants (scheme `YYYY-MM-DD.N`) in the 5 persisting
  prompts; hand-written migration 0031 adds 6 nullable TEXT stamps
  (`companies` × 4 family-scoped, `funding_rounds`, `competitors`); every
  persisting write path stamps, incl. reconcile-round restamp-on-merge and
  merge-time gap-fill semantics. NULL = pre-versioning cohort. Unblocks W-F's
  targeted re-enrichment.

## PR #138 — W-C.2/C.3-web/C.4: web bug sweep (merged 2026-07-10)

- W-C.2: missing/partial Supabase env on Vercel now throws
  `SupabaseConfigError` (pages 500 loudly) instead of rendering an
  empty-catalog 404-everywhere site; off-Vercel (secret-free CI, local dev)
  keeps degrading to empty. All 23 swallow sites collapsed onto one
  `supabaseOrNull()` rethrowing helper. Deviation from plan: keyed on the
  `VERCEL` env rather than NODE_ENV/build-phase — simpler, covers build and
  runtime, zero CI changes.
- W-C.3 (web): META_LEAK regex now lives once in `lib/competitor-guards.ts`,
  used by Competitors.tsx and getAlternatives.
- W-C.4: total-raised = max(stated, sum deduped on (round_type, amount))
  lives once in `lib/funding.ts`; the OG card and compare table summed
  naively before (their selects now fetch round_type so the dedup key
  matches the company-page tile). Helion-style regression tests. 149 web
  tests total. **W-C is complete** (C.1 #132, C.5/C.6 #133, C.3-pipeline
  #134, C.2/C.3-web/C.4 #138).

## PRs #139/#140/#143 — eval-record workflow (merged 2026-07-11)

- `workflow_dispatch`-only workflow that re-records the golden set against
  live DeepSeek (the API key exists only as an Actions secret) and pushes a
  reviewable branch. #140 fixed a YAML parse bug (unindented commit-message
  lines terminated the `run: |` block — GitHub's tell is the workflow
  registering with its path as its name); #143 made PR-creation failure
  non-fatal (repo settings forbid Actions-created PRs; kept that way).
- First live run: all 40 fixtures recorded (0 failures). Gate correctly
  flagged simulated-vs-live drift — headline: tags_f1 0.265 vs 0.986 floor
  (live DeepSeek's tag vocabulary diverges from hand-authored tags).
  Recordings held on branch `eval-record/20260711-081233` until W-F's
  golden-set rewrite lands; floors get recalibrated against live output in
  one pass after that.

## PR #141 — W-E.4: slug aliases + 308 redirects (merged 2026-07-11)

- Migration 0032: `slug_aliases` (old_slug natural PK — documented exception;
  company_id FK CASCADE, indexed). `merge_companies` repoints the loser's
  aliases before the delete (chains converge: A→B then B→C leaves a→C),
  clears survivor-slug shadows, upserts the dying slug.
- Web: `getAliasTargetSlug` + `permanentRedirect` (308) on the miss path of
  /c/[slug] and /alternatives/[slug]. Deviation from plan: no middleware — a
  per-request DB hit to serve the rare dead-slug case loses to a
  miss-path-only lookup (valid slugs pay zero extra queries).

## PR #142 — ops workflow (merged 2026-07-11)

- Dispatch-gated `ops.yml`: choice-allowlisted `exclude-company` /
  `unexclude-company` against prod (only Actions holds DATABASE_URL — the
  runbook's manual + rollback levers had no execution path). First consumer:
  the Aidoc residual (Tel Aviv HQ confirmed in the infer-hq-country dry run;
  the apply run's fetch flaked and the one-shot `hq_country_checked_at`
  stamp would never re-select it).

## PR #144 — W-D: discovery expansion + adapter resilience (merged 2026-07-11)

- Shared JSON-island walker (`vc_portfolios/_json_island.py`) replaces the
  a16z / Founders Fund / Felicis triplicates.
- Uniform hard-fail contract: `AdapterStructuralError` + `ensure_entries` —
  zero-yield parses raise instead of returning `[]` (8 adapters silently
  degraded before); per-firm isolation in the callers verified; canaries
  strengthened for all 13 VC adapters + mangled-fixture structural-miss
  tests.
- New feeds riding ingest-news + auto-create: GeekWire funding tag (live: 6
  entries/30d) and VentureBeat main feed with a title+lede keyword gate (no
  funding-specific VB feed exists). `adapter-health` probes the six news
  feeds and is now actually wired into discovery.yml (annotate-only).
- Accelerator lists (Techstars/500 Global/Antler/Alchemist) documented as
  JS-only skips; GitHub-trending mapper deferred (needs an LLM pass).
- Known follow-up (task chip): the funding-keyword matcher substring-matches
  "evaluations" → "valuation".

## Prod operations log (2026-07-11)

- **Non-US drain (lever 1)**: dry-run batch 1 (40 checked → 3 intended
  exclusions, all verified correct); apply batch 1 excluded Ada (DE) + AIM
  (CY), Aidoc flaked → handled via ops.yml exclusion with the dry-run
  evidence; batch 2 (limit 80) dispatched.
- **Non-startup re-judge (lever 2)**: batch 1 (200-limit): 22 judged, 15
  excluded. Batch 2 dispatched.
- Batches repeat until each lever reports an empty selection, per the
  runbook.

## PR #145 — W-F: richer company descriptions (merged 2026-07-11)

- Judge/describe prompt split: new `company_description_long` whose entire
  job is the profile — seven source-gated dimensions, ~350–600-word /
  4–7-paragraph depth floor on rich input, grounding rules that outrank
  style (never pad, never invent, null over filler). Judge prompt keeps
  classification/people/HQ/short-description.
- Two-call enrich flow (judge 32k input; describe 48k, only for kept
  companies with ≥700 chars of text — thin sites get an honest null instead
  of filler). `--redescribe-outdated` regenerates only description_long for
  stale-stamped rows, oldest-version-first, riding the standing cron (no new
  workflow input). Subpages 3→5.
- Cost flagged: ≤2 calls/company (~$1–2/1000 realistic); full ~2.6k backlog
  re-description ≈ $4 realistic / $11 worst-case, one-time.
- Verified on prod after merge: AppsFlyer ~900 grounded words (rich site);
  Cognition an honest 3-paragraph thin-site profile that says so plainly.

## PRs #146–#149 — W-F hardening + the red-main incident (2026-07-11)

- **#146**: the 13:15/15:54 crons were killed at the 30-min job backstop
  (W-F's 25-min enrich budget no longer fit beside news/funding) — raised to
  45 min.
- **#147**: first live re-recording exposed that the golden "rich" inputs
  (~250 words each) couldn't honestly support the depth floor (live output
  tracked input length ~1:1). All 12 rich inputs expanded to ~1,500-word
  multi-page site text; grounding proxy's initialism artifact fixed (real
  fabrications still penalized).
- **#148**: live re-record against the rich inputs: `rich_word_mean` 242 →
  **480**, grounding_mean 0.970; floors anchored to live behavior via
  `--update-baseline`.
- **#149**: repaired a real W-F bug CI had been flagging: the describe
  prompt's version started at `2026-07-10.1`, colliding with the pre-split
  cohort's stamp, so `--redescribe-outdated` would have silently skipped
  every row the old prompt enriched. Bumped to `2026-07-11.1`.
- **Incident (owned by the orchestrator)**: main was red from #145's merge
  (~08:54) to #149's (~22:15) because the DB-gated
  `test_redescribe_selection_boundaries` failure was masked by
  `gh pr checks | grep | tail` pipelines swallowing exit codes — #145–#148
  merged without a verified-green pipeline job, violating the series' own
  first rule. Prod impact nil (the drain ran on NULL-stamp selection; live
  pages verified correct). Corrective practice: every merge now verifies the
  full `statusCheckRollup` JSON explicitly; no grep/tail between the check
  and the decision.

## Prod operations log (2026-07-11, continued)

- Non-US drain resumed post-verification: batch 3 (limit 100) applied 7 more
  sourced exclusions (Atlas/NO, Audiomob/GB, Beacon/GB, Behavox/GB, Bird/NL,
  Blockchain/AE, Boards/IL). Three-stage drain loop running: infer →
  re-judge → description re-enrichment (90/run), each to empty selection,
  with the 3-hourly cron as fallback drain.

# Initiative 2 — hygiene wave + Wave 3 (plan: 2026-07-11-hygiene-and-wave3-embeddings.md)

## PR #150 — H-1: prominent-husk rescue (merged 2026-07-11)

- Root cause of Perplexity-class husks: a 200–699-char dead zone (thin SPA
  shells too rich for the 200-char headless trigger, too thin for the
  700-char describe gate) + the 90-day refetch window + no needs-description
  selection tier ⇒ prominent companies re-scraped the same shell quarterly,
  forever.
- Fix (scrape stage only): shown description-less companies sort first,
  refetch on a 7-day cycle, and force the Playwright render below the
  describe threshold (imported from enrich — single source of truth). Enrich
  picks rescues up unchanged (end-to-end test).

## PR #151 — H-2: canonical tag vocabulary (merged 2026-07-11)

- `util/tags.py`: 96 canonical tags / 417 match keys; consolidates, never
  gates (unknown tags pass through). Applied at the enrich write path, the
  eval replay path, and as an idempotent `normalize-taxonomy` tags pass.
  Judge prompt tightened (3–6 established tags) → 2026-07-11.1; verified the
  bump re-selects no cohort.
- Review catch: the PR's pipeline check went red because the map folded
  `api-first`→`api` and `cloud-native`→`cloud`; a pre-existing DB-gated test
  correctly pinned those as distinct concepts. Fixed the map, not the test —
  and the explicit statusCheckRollup gate (post-incident discipline) is what
  caught it before merge this time.

## PR #152 — H-3: matcher word-boundaries + GitHub-trending discovery (merged 2026-07-11)

- Funding keywords now match on word boundaries ("evaluations" no longer
  triggers "valuation" — the live W-D false positive); all five feed
  consumers inherit; hyphenated/wrapped true positives pinned.
- GitHub-trending mapper: robots-checked (daily page only — `?since=` is
  disallowed), cheapest-first gating (known-owner skip → personal-account
  skip → DeepSeek company judgment, null-on-uncertainty), auto-create with
  `discovered_via=github_trending`, weekly discovery.yml step +
  adapter-health probe. <1¢/run.

## Prod operations log (2026-07-11/12, drains)

- Non-US lever: +500 checked across batches 4–8 (loop v3 continuing to
  empty). Re-judge lever: complete — its worklist drained; the 3–4/batch
  tail was interleaved crons' normal judge trickle, not rejudge re-selects.
- Re-description: ~670 profiles rewritten by the drain loop so far (batches
  of ~80–90 writes each) on top of cron contributions; v3 continues to the
  two-consecutive-zero stop.

## PR #153 — E-1: pgvector embeddings + similar companies (merged 2026-07-12)

- Migration 0033: `vector` extension (CI service image → pgvector/pgvector:pg15),
  `embedding vector(384)` + `embedded_at` + `embedding_text_hash`, and the
  `similar_companies` RPC (cosine, SQL-side exclusion filtering). No vector
  index at ~3k rows — revisit threshold documented and schema-pinned.
- `embed-companies` stage: fastembed bge-small-en-v1.5 (optional `embeddings`
  dependency group), SQL hash-diff selection, wired after enrich (200/run,
  $0 LLM). Model dir Actions-cached.
- Web: similar-companies replaces the heuristic `similar` edges when
  embeddings exist (heuristic fallback kept), with per-card similarity
  provenance. Verified by the subagent against a real pgvector container
  (1378 DB-gated tests + a live-model ranking smoke).

## PR #154 — E-3: themes (merged 2026-07-12)

- Migration 0034: `themes` (centroid vector, funding recent/prior/growth,
  prompt_version) + `company_themes`. `compute-themes`: per-industry KMeans
  (deterministic; HDBSCAN rejected — noise-labels small industries), DeepSeek
  cluster naming (null-over-fabricate: incoherent clusters dropped),
  replace-per-industry with ≥0.9-cosine centroid matching for slug stability
  (re-run with unchanged embeddings = zero LLM calls), 25-day TTL gate inside
  the stage riding weekly discovery.yml ⇒ monthly cadence. ≤$0.05/run.
- Web: /themes ranked by funding growth + /themes/[slug] (similarity-ordered
  members, server-rendered SVG funding-by-quarter, new entrants), sitemap
  ≥3-member threshold, Themes in nav. First real compute lands once the
  embed backlog drains.

## E-2 spike (no PR — evidence branch fable5/semantic-search-spike)

- Verdict GO: transformers.js runs the exact stored model in a Next 16 route
  handler on Vercel Hobby — cosine parity 0.9974 with fastembed vectors
  (CLS pooling is load-bearing), 2–3ms warm, ~58–92MB of the 250MB function
  budget (onnxruntime's native binary needs outputFileTracingIncludes).
  Supabase Edge rejected (gte-small ≠ bge space); Cloudflare Workers AI
  documented as plan-B (requires pooling:"cls"). Build in flight as 0035.

## Prod operations log (2026-07-12)

- Drain v3 → v4: v3's dispatch cadence was displacing pending crons (GitHub
  keeps one pending run per concurrency group), starving the scheduled
  scrape/enrich for hours — which is why the H-1 husk rescue hadn't landed on
  the live site. v4 waits for an empty queue before every dispatch.

## PR #155 — E-2: semantic search (merged 2026-07-12)

- Migration 0035 `semantic_companies` RPC; server-only transformers.js query
  embedder (exact stored model, CLS pooling, revision-pinned, 4s timeout,
  null → graceful lexical fallback); model bundled at build via a fail-soft
  prebuild script with the linux-x64 onnx binary traced explicitly.
- /companies hybrid blend: lexical first, semantic extras appended with
  honest totals + disclosure; gated to page 1, default sort, and no active
  column filters (extras under a filter would violate it). Independent
  code-review pass on the branch: zero findings.
- **Wave 3 complete** (E-1 #153, E-3 #154, E-2 #155). Semantic behavior
  activates in prod as the next pipeline crons apply migrations 0033–0035
  and drain the embed backlog (~1–2 days at 200/run × 8/day); until then
  every new surface degrades to its pre-Wave-3 behavior by construction.

## Prod operations log — drains COMPLETE (2026-07-12)

- **Non-US drain finished**: final batch selected 0 (≈770 companies checked
  across all batches; all exclusions carry quoted registered-office sources).
- **Re-description drain finished**: two consecutive zero-write batches after
  ~1.7k+ profiles regenerated under the W-F prompt (drain batches + cron).
- One-off failed run explained: the H-2 PR's gitleaks job flaked with
  "failed to scan Git repository: stderr is not empty" (action infra, not a
  leak); the next push re-ran green. Pin/retry the action if it recurs.

## Docs refresh + handoff (2026-07-12)

- README caught up to the shipped surface (semantic search, themes, similar
  companies, durable URLs, new stages/workflows, pgvector dev image,
  two-call enrich); BACKLOG annotated with SHIPPED markers; CLAUDE.md gained
  the prompt-version/golden-gate and embeddings conventions plus the
  DB-gated-tests-run-in-CI warning.
- `docs/superpowers/HANDOFF.md` written for the next agent: working
  agreement, environment gotchas, autonomous processes, open items,
  architecture pointers.
