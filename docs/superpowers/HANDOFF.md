# Handoff — state of the world as of 2026-07-12

Written for the next agent (any model) picking this project up cold. Read
this, then root `CLAUDE.md` (conventions), then the worklog
(`docs/superpowers/fable5-worklog.md` — one entry per merged PR, the
authoritative history), then the two plan docs under
`docs/superpowers/plans/` (2026-07-10 improvement plan; 2026-07-11 hygiene +
Wave 3). `BACKLOG.md` is annotated with what shipped.

## What just happened (25 merged PRs, #131–#155)

Two initiatives, both complete:

1. **2026-07-10 improvement plan** — web test suite (Vitest+RTL+Playwright),
   LLM eval golden set + harness, shared per-domain HTTP throttle, secret-leak
   prevention (gitleaks + client-bundle canary scan + `server-only`
   boundary), bug sweep (loud Vercel misconfig, one META_LEAK guard, deduped
   total-raised), prompt-version provenance stamps (migration 0031), the W-F
   description rewrite (judge/describe prompt split, ~350–600-word grounded
   profiles), discovery expansion (GeekWire/VentureBeat, uniform adapter
   hard-fail contract), slug aliases + 308 redirects (0032).
2. **Hygiene + Wave 3** — husk rescue (prominent description-less companies
   prioritized + force-rendered), canonical tag vocabulary, word-boundary
   funding keywords + GitHub-trending discovery, then the embeddings stack:
   pgvector + `embed-companies` (0033), themes (0034), semantic search
   (0035).

## Working agreement (user-set, standing)

- User owns product; agent owns technical execution, full autonomy on
  reversible engineering decisions. Stop only for product/architecture
  changes, destructive-beyond-git actions, or true blockers.
- Branch per slice (`fable5/<name>` — adopt your own prefix), PR via `gh`,
  **merge your own PR when CI is green**, squash + delete branch. Verify the
  FULL `statusCheckRollup` JSON explicitly before every merge — piping
  `gh pr checks` through grep/tail once masked a red pipeline job and main
  was red for 13 hours (worklog: "red-main incident"). Never merge red.
- Commit trailer exactly: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8
  <noreply@anthropic.com>` (user-specified; see worklog preamble). PR bodies
  end with the Claude Code attribution line.
- Worklog entry per merged PR; docs-only worklog commits go directly to main.
- DeepSeek is the runtime LLM — never swap it. Cost is not a constraint but
  flag any material spend before incurring it.

## Environment facts (will bite you if unknown)

- **No local Postgres/DB URL/DeepSeek key.** DB-gated tests (~500) skip
  locally and run in CI's Postgres service (`pgvector/pgvector:pg15`).
  A container runtime (OrbStack) exists — recent agents ran the full
  DB-gated suite against a local `pgvector/pgvector:pg15` container; do that
  for migration work if you can.
- **Actions is the only prod lever.** `pipeline.yml` (3-hourly; at GitHub's
  25-input cap — a new input must displace one; prefer new behavior riding
  existing steps/flags), `discovery.yml` (weekly), `backfill-discovery.yml`,
  `ops.yml` (exclude/unexclude by slug), `eval-record.yml` (live golden-set
  re-recording → pushes a branch; repo settings forbid Actions-created PRs).
- **Concurrency displacement:** DB-writing workflows share one concurrency
  group; GitHub keeps only the newest PENDING run — queued dispatches
  displace each other and the cron. Batch loops must re-dispatch on
  `cancelled` and should wait for an empty queue between dispatches or they
  starve the cron (this happened; see worklog "drain v4").
- The user's Mac disk runs near-full; prune `.claude/worktrees/` and
  node_modules/.next copies after agents finish.

## Autonomous processes currently running (no babysitting required)

- The 3-hourly pipeline cron: news/funding/scrape/enrich (+ husk rescue
  priority), `embed-companies --limit 200` (embed backlog drains ~1–2 days
  from 2026-07-12), redescribe tail, judge.
- Weekly discovery cron: VC portfolios, GitHub trending, dedup, competitors,
  `compute-themes` (TTL-gated monthly — the FIRST themes run happens on the
  next weekly run after embeddings exist).
- Both one-time prod drains are COMPLETE: non-US exclusions (runbook lever 1,
  drained to empty selection) and the W-F re-description backlog (~1.7k+
  profiles regenerated; gate = two consecutive zero-write batches).

## Verification commands

pipeline/: `uv sync && uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy src && uv run
pytest -q` (golden gate included; `uv run nous eval-prompts` for the metric
table). web/: `npm ci && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build &&
npm run check:bundle && npm run test:e2e` (e2e structural block passes
secret-free — that's the CI contract).

## Open items, in priority order

1. **Wave 3 activation check (~a day out):** once the embed backlog drains —
   verify on the live site: semantic extras + disclosure on
   `/companies?q=ai+for+logistics`; similar-companies sections render;
   Perplexity (and other rescued husks) have profiles; first themes run
   populates `/themes` after the weekly discovery cron. Also confirm the
   Vercel build log showed `[download-model] bundled …; probe ok (384
   dims)` and the `/companies` function size (~58–92MB) — the E-2 PR (#155)
   body carries the full checklist.
2. **Golden floors for judge/funding prompts** are still conservative
   hand-set values; after the next live `eval-record` run, anchor them with
   `--update-baseline` like the long-description prompt already is.
3. **Known small follow-ups:** gitleaks-action flaked once on a PR
   ("stderr is not empty" — infra, not a leak; pin/retry if it recurs);
   fastembed model download in web CI is fail-soft-unverified per run (check
   the prebuild log line if semantic search ever silently degrades);
   retired theme slugs get no aliases (accepted; revisit if themes URLs get
   shared widely).
4. **Next product waves (user decides):** Wave 4 habit loop (weekly digest +
   RSS, momentum signals, `company_events` timeline), industry pages +
   `/trends` (both ride existing data), X-vs-Y compare pages, market map.
   The 2026-07-11 plan's "not committed scope" section and BACKLOG.md hold
   the details.

## Key architecture pointers

- Enrichment: `pipeline/src/nous/pipeline/enrich_companies.py` (two-call
  judge/describe flow, stamping semantics documented inline).
- Eval harness: `pipeline/src/nous/evals/` + `pipeline/tests/golden/README.md`
  (edit prompt → re-record live → review deltas → commit).
- Embeddings: stage `embed_companies.py`; RPCs `similar_companies` (0033) and
  `semantic_companies` (0035); web query embedder `web/lib/embed-query.ts`
  (CLS pooling parity is load-bearing).
- Themes: `compute_themes.py` (KMeans, centroid slug-stability, TTL gate).
- Web data layer: `web/lib/queries.ts` (supabaseOrNull pattern: benign
  degrade off-Vercel, loud `SupabaseConfigError` on Vercel).
- Runbook for exclusion sweeps: `docs/runbooks/non-us-and-nonstartup-backfill.md`.
